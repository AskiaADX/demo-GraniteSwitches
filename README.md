Possible variables to be open to the end-users
----------------------------------------------

-	Switch outer oval background gradient
-	Switch inner oval color when normal
-	Switch inner oval color when active
-	Response item color for hover and active states

I would *not* open the switch sizing to end-users as it would oblige them to fiddle around with positioning. I would also not open modification of box-shadows as they're set in rgba, it should be fine with whatever color they decide on using.

Known issues
